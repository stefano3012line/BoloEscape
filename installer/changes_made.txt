moved all objects and functions to a different file

removed all global variables usage:
    - a function doesn't read "score" willy nilly, it is passed as an argument to the function
    - the draw functions don't just call screen.blit, the screen is passed to them as an argument
    - shooter.load_projectile doesn't read "negative_status", it reads self.posssible_statuses which is initialized along with the object

I understand why it was done but now projectile does not just calls heart, when load_projectile is passed amongst its arguments is the sprite the projectiles will use, so its more convenient


I AM ACTUALLY GONNA #$£@&% MURDER YOU PEOPLE IF YOU DONT START *ç%^&%$ PUTTING SPACES AFTER COMMAS IN FUNCTION'S ARGUMENTS GODDAMMIT
I ACTUALLY PUT PROOF IN THIS VERY FOLDER, PLEASE TELL ME WHICH IS MORE READABLE YOU FOOLS, YOU ABSOLUTE BUFFOONS

AND DON'T PUT SPACES IN FILENAMES ITS JUST PLAIN WRONG AND MAKES THEM SO MUCH HARDER TO USE


consiglio mmolto caldo:
    NIENTE STATUS LIST NEL PLAYER, SI FA PER OGNI EFFETTO UN BOOLEANO, IS_CONFUSED, IS_ONFIRE, IS_INVINCIBLE, PERCHè FATTO CON UNA LISTA è UN CASINO DA TRACCIARE OGNI VOLTA
